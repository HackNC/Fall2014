				<h1>What is HackNC?</h1>
				<div class="maincopy">
					<p>HackNC is a hackathon for university students to create big things in a small amount of time - 24 hours between October 25th and 26th.  Your skill as a programmer, team member, and planner will be tested as you work to create anything from websites, to apps, to games, to hardware.  Along the way you will have access to food, internet, swag, mentors, and anything else you need to succeed.  In the end, the best projects will be awarded prizes!</p>
					<p>If you are looking for something different from the typical hackathon, HackNC has something for you too.  Throughout the entire event there will be hands-on demos, lectures, and tutorials from sponsors, professionals, and professors that range from introductory concepts to the latest groundbreaking research.  And unlike most other hackathons, HackNC is not only for advanced programmers at the university level.  If you are a high school student, college student, or local professional who is interested in learning all the ints and outs of computer science, the introductory lessons are for you.</p>
					<p>So bring your curiosity and creativity and be ready to do something new at HackNC!</p>
