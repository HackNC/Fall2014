		<h1>What is HackNC?</h1>
		<span class="maincopy"> HackNC is a place for university and high school students alike to come together and create big things in a small amount of time - specifically 24 hours. The event is typically a test of skill, teamwork and time management for those who know their way around the code to create anything from websites to games to hardware. In the end, the best projects are awarded prizes! 
But don’t worry, HackNC is not just for the advanced programmer, the event also aims toward educating those less familiar with the “ints” and outs. Guest lectures, hands-on demos, and tutorials from sponsors, experts, and professors that range from introductory concepts to the latest groundbreaking research will be key focuses during the event in hopes of inspiring the curious and the creative no matter the level of expertise.</span>
